			<p>...All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise, not from the defects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation...</p>

			After the beginning of the Great Recession in 2009, many Americans were left wishing they had paid better attention in Economics 101.  There are few subjects that have a greater effect on our every day lives. Yet, there are fewer still that are more misunderstood.  An accurate Economic model guides a person to make wise investments and career choices. It helps them understand the chaos around them and press forward unfazed. It provides awareness of dangers which others are blind to. Sound like an important tool for serving others?  I think so and have made economics a foremost area of expertise. I had the privilege of being heavily involved in the development of DGI’s economic and investment philosophy which is covered in “Economic Stability Regardless, stoicism for your economy”.
